# Technical Writing Samples — Ramón A. Fernández Do Campo

Public, non-confidential samples to demonstrate my approach to **docs‑as‑code** (Markdown, Git/GitHub, PR reviews), **topic‑based authoring**, and clear, user‑centred procedures.

## How I work
- **Docs‑as‑code**: Markdown, Git/GitHub (PR review, issues), VS Code.  
- **Structure**: topic‑based (task/concept/reference), with prerequisites → steps → validation → troubleshooting.  
- **Consistency**: mini style guide + glossary; review checklist enforced during PRs.  
- **Evidence**: steps **tested** in a small Home Assistant test instance (in progress), with logs/screenshots captured when relevant.
